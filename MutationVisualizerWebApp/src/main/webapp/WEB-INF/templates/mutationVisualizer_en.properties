about.txt=The DNA is a complete package containing the inherited traits you have been given by your parents, and is unique. DNA is transcribed into RNA, which in turn is translated to a protein sequence that has a certain function, for example the pigmentation of your hair or eyes. But what would happen if we could simply change our DNA ourselves? This application was created to demonstrate in a simplified manner what the relationship is between your DNA and you, and how changing your DNA structure could have small or big consequences on how the proteins that you make would look like! This project was created for the final assignment for Theme 10 of the BioInformatics courses held at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, with the goal of making it easier for new students to see how biology and programming can come together and offer both a physical and virtual way to craft with DNA.
complement.txt=Complement string:
dna.txt=DNA:
missense.title=Missense mutation:
missense.txt= While the sequence changes with a missense mutation, the function doesn't have to. The change in function is determined by the importance of the amino acid.
mutation.title=Mutation title:
mutation.txt=This textblock will explain the type of mutation that took place.
nav.title=The central dogma
nonsense.title=Nonsense mutation:
nonsense.txt=With a nonsense mutation an early stopcodon has been placed in the protein, meaning the protein isn't completed.
nuc.change=Change in nucleotide:
protein.txt=Protein:
rna.txt=RNA:
silent.title=Silent mutation:
silent.txt=With a silent mutation the nucleotide sequence changes, but the protein sequence doesn't. This is possible because some codons code for the same amino acid.
step1.hdr=Step 1
step1.title=Transcription
step1.txt=During transcription the coding DNA stand gets translated to mRNA. This mRNA is the opposite of the coding strand and a copy of the complementary strand, with the exception being that every T becomes a U.
step2.hdr=Step 2
step2.title=Translation
step2.txt=During translation mRNA gets translated to aminoacids. Every three mRNA nucleotides form a codon which gets translated to it's complementary aminoacid, the first codon is the startcodon ATG and the final a stopcodon. The mRNA gets read and the aminoacids are put toghether in this codon order.
step3.hdr=Step 3
step3.title=Protein folding
step3.txt=After the aminoacids are put thogether they form a polypeptidechain. This then undergoes folding driven by interactions between the aminoacids in the chain. These folds determine the form and function of the protein which is formed by one or multiple chains.
title.msg=Welcome to this web application about the central dogma. This site will try to show how the dogma works, how a protein is formed from DNA and to show what this process looks like and what changes in the DNA can do to the protein.
title.txt=The central dogma
translation.nav=Translation
translation.txt=Here a sequence will be collected with it's complementary strand, mRNA sequence and aminoacid sequence. After pressing the button a mutation will occur in the sequence, the change will be presented in the middle and the effects of the change will be shown and explained in the textbox to the right.
